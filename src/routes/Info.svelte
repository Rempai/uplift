        Uplift is a game set in the near future, one where the gig economy has kept expanding and
        taxi licensing has become impossibly complicated! So much so, that the only viable way for
        a ride-sharing service to exist, is to offer a complimentary service to get around
        licensing issues. In Upliftâ€™s case, the service provided is one of psychological advice. Go
        to <a href="http://deugd.net">Deugd.net</a> for more info about virtues.

      <h4>De Buitenkamer</h4>
      <p>
        Uplift is being designed as a student project at the behest of De Buitenkamer (<a
          href="https://buitenkamer.org">https://buitenkamer.org</a
        >). Who gave students at The Hague University of Applied Sciences the challenge to create a
        fun and innovative way to practice and learn ethical thinking and skills, as well as
        understanding of the concept of courage in general. The resulting game focuses on analysis
        of ethical problems and recognition of virtues and character skills as they have been
        developed in the field of Positive Psychology.
