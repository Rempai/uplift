# workload
You mentioned the workload, and that it keeps increasing. Could you elaborate?
p}Well, we have to get this list of features done. But [every week the deadline is coming closer and we just seem further from making it each week:workload_furtherfrom].
### workload_furtherfrom
Deadline? When are you supposed to have these features finished?
p}At the end of the week. We have been [dividing the work among ourselves. But some of the work is not being finished:workload_notfinish].
### workload_notfinish
Do you think everyone in the team is pulling their weight?
p}Of course, my friends are [pulling their weight. At least I think so:workload_bulkwork].
### workload_bulkwork
It sounds like you are doing the bulk of the work.
p}No. I mean... maybe. [I can make it though. I just need to get it done:workload_capable].
### workload_capable
I'm sure you're capable, but have you asked for help?
p}Of course I have. [Everyone has lives outside of school:workload_givingall] though.
### workload_givingall
It seems like you are the only one giving it their all.
p}Maybe you're right. [I might have been taking on too much work:workload_fair].
### workload_fair
Do you think that is fair?
p}Hmm, it really isn't. [I should have been more clear about my feelings:workload_reduced].
### workload_reduced
What if you reduced your workload?
p}I don't think that's possible at this point. [My friends and school career would be in trouble:workload_sacrifice].
### workload_sacrifice
Is it work sacrificing your health and mental well-being though?
p}Yes, [I don't want to end up as a glorified taxi driver:workload_check]... No offence.
### workload_check
The job isn't that bad, except for the pay, benefits, and that social credit score check every Monday.
p}Who is getting therapy again? Lower patience by 1.
