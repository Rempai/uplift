#stress
y}You seem stressed, are you ok?
I think so. [Getting this all of my chest is making me feel a bit calmer:stress-split1].
###stress-split1
y}I'm glad talking about your problems helps. Do you talk to anyone else about your troubles?
Not really, never had to before. It's like [this pressure that has been building up:stress-split2].
###stress-split2
y}What does this pressure feel like?
It's hard to describe. I just feel overwhelmed as of late. Even the simplest issue makes me feel so defeated. [It's like everything is happening around me and i just happen to be present:stress-split3].
###stress-split3
y}That is concerning. Those are signs of burnout.Where do you think these feelings are coming from?
Well it is definitely all the project work. I also just [can't seem to relax when I'm with my friends:stress-split4]. I feel like they are judging me for not always getting stuff done in time.
###stress-split4
y}Have you tried doing something without your friends to relax?
I tried, but nothing works. [I think I just have to finish the project:stress-split5].
###stress-split5
y}You think that finishing all the work is the only option?
[Yes. I really can't think of anything else:stress-split6].
###stress-split6
y}Hmmm, no hobbies?
[I can't have fun without feeling guilty:stress-split7].
###stress-split7
y}Can't think of anything else?
This isn't helping me... Lower patience by 1
