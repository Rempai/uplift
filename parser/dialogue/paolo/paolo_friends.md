# friends

You are in a group project with your friends, how is that experience?
p}It's difficult. I like being able to hang out with them at school, [but there is also a lot of pressure to do well:friends_pressure].

### friends_pressure

Your friends are pressuring you?
p}Oh no, not directly anyway. [I just don't want to let them down:friends_important]. I just have to stay strong and persevere.

### friends_important

Are their opinions that important to you?
p}Of course. I don't want to be left out. [They are all so funny and interesting:friends_aware], meanwhile I'm just there...

### friends_aware

Are your friends aware of how you feel?
p}I'm not sure. I haven't spoken to them about it. [I'm afraid and unsure of how they would react:friends_talk]. Like I said, I already feel like an outlier, [I don't want to make them realize that I don't fit in:friends_talk].

### friends_talk

I think you should talk to your friends about these issues. Your work ethic is admirable, but unsustainable.
p}I- I know. [It's just so hard to tell them the truth:friends_truth]. I want them to see me as reliable, but it's all fake.

### friends_truth

A true friend tells the truth, even if it risks the friendship. The big man in the sky said so.
You just have to work up the willpower to tell the truth even when you are afraid of the consequences.
p}Thank you. I'll have to think about that. +1 patience
