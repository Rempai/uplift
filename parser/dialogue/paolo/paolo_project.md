# project

What is this programming project about?
p}We are making a real-time weather app. So we want people to just open the app and get the weather forecast on their location. [It sounds easy, but it's pretty complex. At least my part is:project_part].

### project_part

What is your part of the project?
p}I am responsible for getting all the data we are working with and doing the forecast. Storing all the data is also my job. [It's a lot of work, but I'm getting the hang of it:project_much].

### project_much

You are responsible for all of that? Isn't that a bit much?
p}[Well, I wanted to do all that. It was my choice:project_chose].

### project_chose

You chose to put that much weight on your shoulders by yourself?
p}Yes, I did. It sounded fun, [and my friends encouraged me as well:project_encouraged]. They know I'm good at all that noodley stuff.

### project_encouraged

Your friends encouraged you to do this?
p}I told you, [it was also my choice:project_purechoice].

### project_purechoice

Are you sure this was purely your choice?
p}Yes I am. Can we move on to another topic now? [I just have to work harder:project_notsolution]. -1 patience

### project_notsolution

Working harder is not a solution to your problems?
p}What else can I do at this point? -1 patience
