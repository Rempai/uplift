Good morning, you must be Paolo.
p}Oh hi, are you my taxi driver?
Yes I am. Where to?
p}To Woodbridge Avenue, please.
We have about 20 minutes together. I don't know what we will be able to make of it, but I hope we can make something of it. I'd be glad to know whatever concerns you.
p}Well, right now I'm nervous. This is the first time I've used Uplift, so please be patient with me.
You are doing great. If this is your first time, why start now?
p}Well, the main thing I want to talk to you about is about school. [It's been real tough lately:stress].
School has been tough because...?
p}[I have been working on a JavaScript programming school project:project] with 4 friends. It was fun at first, [but then the work started piling up:workload]. [The project has been replacing my social life:friends].
The work started piling up?
p}[It's just too much. I find myself working late into the night:workload], [otherwise the team would fall behind. I don't want to let them down:friends].
Has there been any improvement?
p}Last night was no different, but [I couldn't finish my work:workload]. [I laid in bed shaking from the fear of letting my friends down:stress].
And then you ordered this Uplift ride.
p}Yes, today I woke up with [cramping hands from typing:workload], and [I just had to call in sick. No matter how hard I work it keeps going wrong:stress].
Mhm.
p}[I don't want the project to fail:project], [But it's ruining my social life:friends]. [I can't stand this stress anymore:stress]. Can you help me?
Of course. Thank you for the explanation. I think it's time for me to ask some pointed questions.
