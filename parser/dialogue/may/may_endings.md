#### unconvinced

I think he's doing just fine. He seems to love his work, so I'm sure it'll work out alright.
m}Are you really sure about that? I'm not convinced.
m}Well, thank you anyways I guess. I'll see where this goes...

#### unconvinced but warned

I think you should try telling him to work a bit less. Maybe his health issues will go away that way.
m}I'll give that a shot, thanks.

#### convinced but only slightly

Considering the risks involved, I can understand why you'd want him to work less.
Maybe you can use the risks to convince him to work less?
It'd be pretty dangerous if he was working while sleepy, after all.
m}I think I'll give that a shot, thanks.

#### convinced but stopping slowly

Maybe it would be good to talk with him, there might be a deeper reason to why he keeps working.
m}That's a good idea, I wonder why I hadn't thought of that before...
Well, you know what they say: there's no time like the present.
If you hear him out, you might be able to reach a solution both of you agree on. Good luck!
m}Thanks!

#### fully convinced

I think I've gotten a good look at the issues at play, Talking about these issues might be enough to make him realize the dangers of continuing.
After all, it's harmful to his health and your relationship isn't doing so great either.
m}But I've tried bringing it up before, he just waves it off.
Maybe he doesn't grasp the gravity of the situation. Wait for a good moment and try to convey your worries.
m}Well, I'll give it a try. Thanks for the advice.
